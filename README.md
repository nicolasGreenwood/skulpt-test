# A Simple Python Playground Built with Skulpt

An essential step in building a platform where we can share our Python games from Team Coding Pros, this is a small Python playground where you can run your Python programs on the web! Optimizations are in construction, including Python input handling and better UI. Feel free to try it out! Keep it silple with small programs without a lot of complexity, as input functions and advanced Python 3 operations may not run successfully as of now.
